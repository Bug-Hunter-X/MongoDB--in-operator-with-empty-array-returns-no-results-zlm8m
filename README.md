# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array
This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using the `$in` operator with an empty array in MongoDB queries.

## Bug Description
The `$in` operator is typically used to match documents where a field's value is present in a given array. However, when the array is empty, the query unexpectedly returns no results, even if the field exists in the documents.

## Bug Reproduction
1.  Create a MongoDB collection with some documents.
2.  Execute a query using the `$in` operator with an empty array.
3.  Observe that no results are returned, regardless of whether the field exists in the documents.

## Solution
To solve this, ensure you only use the `$in` operator when you have at least one element in the array. Consider alternative approaches such as explicitly checking for the field's existence or using other operators depending on the query's specific logic.
